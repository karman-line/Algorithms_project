# NYC Construction Worker Accident Report
(This repository is for the final project on using classifiers for Algorithms class.)

Construction work is amongst the most dangerous jobs in New York City, and injuries and fatalities have only risen over the years. Even in 2020 buildings under construction were on the rise, undeterred by the pandemic. By the end of the year, worker injuries had doubled since 2019.

The most common accidents are those from falls. New York’s high-rise skyscrapers are dangerous workplaces, and construction sites are required to report to NYC Department of Buildings every time a worker is injured or killed on site. According to a report by law firm O’Dwyer & Bernstien, part of the problem may be attributed to contractors cutting corners to save on their budgets, along with the high burdens often associated with meeting deadlines.
This project attempts to look at how many of these accidents are a result of falls based on the incident descriptions, using a classifier.

Data for the project has been assimilated from NYC Department of Building's monthly Construction Workers Accident reports [https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/about/construction-related-accident-reports.page] from Jan. 2019 to March 2021.

FINDINGS-
Construction workers are prone to falling when ladders are involved. Slipping is a common cause of falls, and the consequences of falling are usually hitting some part of the body. Excavation sites are not common places for falls.
